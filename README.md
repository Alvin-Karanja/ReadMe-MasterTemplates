# ReadMe.md -MasterTemplates
If you are working on your projects and using github, the README.md file is a useful file for you to write good and clear documentations for  your projects.

### HOW TO USE THEM

1. All the files are in markdown format. Not important to learn markdown. That being said, it is always great to have the [Markdown CheatSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
 bookmarked somewhere in your browser.(If you can learn it, awesome! It will save you time...**But it really is not important**). 

2. There are different Markdown templates for each type of project as below: 
    * Android Application
    * Website
    * IOS Application
    * Scripts
