### Description
Despite the fact that you writing a technical document, it needs to be clear. Describing your project makes it easier for

### Why the ReadMe-MasterTemplates?
I lecture and coach technology. With the use of version control, i have noticed a huge struggle among most people to do a brief of what their project is about. Lets face it, most developers are not into typing out prose. 
<br>
In addition, most do not know what to include so that someone else working on their project can benefit.
<br>
This is the foundation behind this project. A smple project that allows you to get started with a well written **ReadMe.md** file.

ReadMe MasterTemplates aims to:
    * Give developers an easy time when writing their project ReadMe.
    * Enable more time to be spent coding out their projects.
    * Help us have better github projects without one liners.
    * Help people who want to use the various projects on github to know more about the project's architecture.

### How to use them

1. All the files are in markdown format. Not important to learn markdown. That being said, it is always great to have the [Markdown CheatSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
 bookmarked somewhere in your browser.(If you can learn it, awesome! It will save you time...**But it really is not important: the more you use markdown, the better you get at it O.o**). 

2. There are different Markdown templates for each type of project as below: 
    * [Android](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/android)- For android focused ReadMe
    * [Website](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/website)- For websites with HTML, CSS and JS
    * IOS ...coming soon
    * Scripts ....coming soon
3. As a general rule, provide link to download the app/website if its published on the playstore at the description section above.
4. Want to contribute? Feel free: it's open source
